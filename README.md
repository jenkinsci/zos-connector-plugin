## About

This plugin provides its functions via FTP connection to IBM z/OS LPAR.
You can configure your SCLM project on z/OS and then check for the
changes via Jenkins.

Features include:
- Submission of user JCL job (with optional log collected upon finish)
- Introduction of SCLM as SCM for your projects allowing to checkout SCLM changes
  - The ability to build SCLM projects currently can be performed **only**Â via 'Submit zOS Job' build action

## Version differences
Kindly back up your JCL texts before upgrading to version [2.0.0].
The [2.0.0] release uses text files instead of plaintext input, so old jobs will become obsolete.

## Configuration
### `JESINTERFACELEVEL` differences
Job Name **must** be configured accordingly to your FTP server
configuration:
- If `JESINTERFACELEVEL=1` is configured, **only** a job named `USERIDx`
(`USERID` - your z/OS user ID, `x` - strictly 1 character) can be
processed correctly (when you are waiting for the job to end).
- If `JESINTERFACELEVEL=2` is configured, no additional considerations are required.
